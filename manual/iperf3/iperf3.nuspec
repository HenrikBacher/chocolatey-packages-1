    <description>__Package fix release to include x86 build.__
	
iPerf3 is a tool for active measurements of the maximum achievable bandwidth on IP networks. It supports tuning of various parameters related to timing, buffers and protocols (TCP, UDP, SCTP with IPv4 and IPv6). For each test it reports the bandwidth, loss, and other parameters. This is a new implementation that shares no code with the original iPerf and also is not backwards compatible. iPerf was orginally developed by NLANR/DAST. iPerf3 is principally developed by ESnet / Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. It is released under a three-clause BSD license.

== 2016-02-01: iperf-3.1.2 released ==
	
* This release fixes a couple of minor bugs, including one that results in invalid JSON being emitted for UDP tests.

== 2015-11-19: iperf-3.1.1 released ==

* This release fixes a few minor bugs.
	
== iperf 3.1 2015-10-16 ==

The release notes for iperf 3.1 describe changes and new
functionality in iperf 3.1, but not present in 3.0.11 or any earlier
3.0.x release.

* Selected user-visible changes

  * SCTP support has been added (with the --sctp flag), on Linux,
    FreeBSD, and Solaris (issue #131).

  * Setting CPU affinity now works on FreeBSD.

  * Selection of TCP congestion now works on FreeBSD, and is now
    called --congestion (the old --linux-congestion option works
    but is now deprecated).

  * A new -I option for the server causes it to write a PID file,
    mostly useful for daemon mode (issue #120).

  * A --logfile argument can now force all output to go to a file,
    rather than to a file.  This is especially useful when running an
    iperf3 server in daemon mode (issue #119).

  * Various compatibility fixes for Android (issue #184, issue #185), iOS (issue #288), NetBSD (issue #248), Solaris (issue #175, issue #178, issue #180, issue #211), vxWorks (issue #268).

  * A --udp-counters-64bit flag has been added to support very
    long-running UDP tests, which could cause a counter to overflow
    (issue #191).

  * A --cport option to specify the client-side port has been added
    (issue #207, issue #209, issue #239).

  * Some calculation errors with the -O feature have been fixed (issue #236).

  * A potential crash in the iperf3 server has been fixed (issue #257,
    issue #258).

  * Many miscellaneous bug fixes.

* Selected developer-visible changes

  * Consumers of libiperf can now get the JSON output for a
    just-completed test (issue #147).

  * Detection of various optional features has been improved to check
    for the presence or absence of platform functionality, not the name
    of platforms.

  * Out-of-tree builds now work (issue #265).</releaseNotes>
